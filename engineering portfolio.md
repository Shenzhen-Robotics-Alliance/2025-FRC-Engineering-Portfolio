+ ### Intake & Shooter

    In the beginning, we tested many schemes to test the intake part, and we tried many schemes. <br> At first, we used a rubber wheel to intake the Coral. The effect is excellent, on this basis we designed a curved structure which is able to intake the Algae. In the top of the robot, we install a trapdoor with a funnel that take the Coral from the station. When the funnel intake the Coral, it will send it to shooter. <br> In addition, the back of the shooter is curved which will take the Algae off the reef. This special structure ensures we can intake both game elements. At the same time, it could reverse rotating and become shooter to hang the Coral. To enhance our efficiency of getting scores, we installed 4 cameras cooperate 4 orange pi to recognize the Code to locate the accurate position in the field. <br> Also, we install an "Elevator" to raise the shooter to reach Level 4 which offer the highest point in the competition. 



+ ### Climb
    Catching the cage is also a giant challenge, we designed two hooks to catching the cage. Before catch the cage, the trapdoor will open so that the catch will rise to help our robot leave the ground and get the Climbing score. To make sure we can catch the cage, we use many component which use carbon fiber material to reduce the weight of robot.
