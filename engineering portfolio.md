+ ### Intake&Shooter

    In the beginning, we tested many schemes to test the intake part, and we tried many schemes. <br> At first, we used a rubber wheel to intake the Coral. The effect is good, on this basis we designed a curved structure, it is also able to intake the Algae. inthe toop of the  robot, we install a trapdoor with a funnel that take the Coral from the station. <br> In addtion, the Intake will take the Algae off the reef. This special structure ensures we can intake both game elements. At the same time, it could reverse rotating and become shooter to hang the Coral. To enhance our efficiency of getting scores, we installed 4 cameras Cooperate 4 orange pi to recognize the Code in the field. <br> Also, we install an "Elevator" to risse the shooter to reach the Level 4 which offer the highest point in the competition. 



+ ### Climb
    Catching the cage is also a giant challenge, we designed two hooks to catch the cage. Before catch the cage, the trapdoor will open so that the catch will rise to help our robot leave the ground and get the Climbing score.
